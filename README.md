## Overview
This is a Docker Github Action written in [Python](https://www.python.org) by [@Gabesw](https://www.github.com/gabesw) that inserts the contents of a markdown file to a certain part of a Confluence page.

## Setup
### Getting Started
Create the `.github/workflows/` directory structure in the root of your repository, if it does not exist, and create a file called `confluence-readme-sync.yml` with the following contents (filling the example parameters with the values listed [here](##action-parameters)):
```yaml
# .github/workflows/confluence-readme-sync.yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  dev:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - uses: gabesw/confluence-readme-sync@v1
        with:
          #filepath: relative/path/to/markdown.md #if commented, will use project's README.md
          url: https://<domain>/wiki/spaces/aSpace/pages/<page id>/<page name>
          username: name@example.org
          token: <Your Confluence API Token>
          insert_start_text: <p>start</p>
          insert_end_text: <p>end</p>
```
### Authorizing the Confluence API
Log into Confluence and navigate to [Manage Profile -> Security -> API Tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens). Create an API token and save the value.
### Using Secrets (Reccomended)
Create secrets in your GitHub repository using this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) for any values you want to keep secure. You can use secrets in your `confluence-readme-sync.yml` file in the place of any value.
```yaml
# .github/workflows/confluence-readme-sync.yml
# ...
token: {{ secrets.confluence_token }}
```

## Action Parameters
| Name | Description | Required | Default |
|--------|--------------|-----------|-----------|
|filepath|The file path of the markdown file to sync, relative to the root of the repository|True|README.md|
|url|The full URL of the Confluence page to sync with, including the https://|True|---|
|username|The Confluence username with which to authenticate API calls. This should be an email address.|True|---|
|token|The Confluence token with wich to authenticate API calls. This token should be accessable and/or generated by the confluence user in `username`|True|---|
|insert_start_text|A piece of HTML in the body of the Confluence page after which the markdown contents will be inserted. You can find this by writing a piece of text or creating any element in confluence and then getting the HTML code of that element from the 'view source' or 'inspect element' feature in your browser. Make sure to grab the whole tag and not just the text inside, or the action will overwrite the closing tag. Eg. use `<p>start text<p>` instead of `start text`.|True|---|
|insert_end_text|A piece of HTML in the body of the Confluence page marking the end of the section in which the markdown content will be inserted. The same guidelines as `insert_start_text` apply for getting the full HTML snippet.|True|---|
## Features
- Automatically uploads local images from your markdown files as Confluence attachments
- Converts markdown image syntax to Confluence image macros
- Preserves external image URLs (images hosted elsewhere remain as external references)
- Supports relative and absolute local image paths
- Handles common image formats (PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG, etc.)

## Limitations
- Code blocks with triple backticks must have a language
- Nested elements in lists will be flattened to the top level when the markdown is converted
- HTML inside of code blocks is encoded when it shouldn't be
- Section links need to be capitalized in confluence but need to be lowercase in markdown

## Future Improvements
- Allow code blocks with no language by mapping the language to None if not present
- Add postprocessor to decode the encoded HTML from code blocks with regex
- Support for image captions and sizing options
- Batch upload optimization for multiple images
